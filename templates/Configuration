# This is a sample configuration file.  It contains most valid
# configuration options, but everything is turned off by default.  So,
# if you install the module and use this file unmodified as your server 
# configuration, your HTML files will be virtually unchanged!
# If you want to change things, either edit this file or use a 
# LookAndFeelConfig file.  I find it's nice to gently ease a site into
# the module by using this sort of "transparent" configuration, and then
# slowly easing in the changes.

# Note:  using hash marks is a bogus comment.  It is just for visual
# distinction -- the program will see a "commented" directive just as
# well as an uncommented one.  It will also ignore text whether or not
# it is "commented" with a hash mark.  The program searches for an
# "@" followed by the directive name.  To comment out a directive without
# erasing it, simply separate the "@" and the directive like this:

@ BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF;

#  The program will completely ignore that last directive.  

# A few tips:  
#
#   1) make sure you terminate all your directives with a semicolon!
#
#   2) do -not- put quotation marks around things unless they need them
#      (inside an <A HREF="whatever.html"> is fine, though).  See the
#      examples below if you're confused.  Just don't go putting
#      quotation marks around colours like BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF";
