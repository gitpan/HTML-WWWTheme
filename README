HTML::WWWTheme is a module that creates a standard header and footer for
HTML pages.  This header includes <BODY> tags, and is designed to wrap
around valid body HTML.

After unpacking the distribution, to install this module type

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
	make test
        make install

There are some sample configuration files in the templates directory that
you may find useful.  Details on how to read from configuration files may
be found in the pod for WWWTheme.

An image (blank.gif) is included with this distribution as an example
-only-. I don't know the legalities of using gifs and all that jazz.  I
created it with the Gimp, if that makes any difference.  If there are any
legal problems with using them on public web servers, DON'T use it.  Make
your own with a registered gif maker.  It's not hard -- it's a 1x1 blank
pixel.
